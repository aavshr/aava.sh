Hello ðŸ‘‹, I am Aavash. 

I am an engineer at <span style="color:#f478b3"> <a href="https://www.deta.sh" target="_blank">Deta</a></span>.

Deta gifted me this `.sh` domain which gave me the idea of writing a shell
as my personal website, thought it would be something fun.

The source code is <span style="color:#fdf0d5"><a href="https://github.com/aavshr/aava.sh" target="_blank">available in Github</a></span> if anyone wants to fork and stuff.
